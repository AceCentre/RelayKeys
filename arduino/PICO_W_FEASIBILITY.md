## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Transmitter Implementation
1. **BLE HID Service**: Implement using Arduino BLE library for Pico W
2. **AT Command Protocol**: Reuse existing command structure from common header
3. **USB Serial**: Standard Arduino Serial for AT commands
4. **Storage**: Use LittleFS for device list persistence
5. **Board Configuration**: Similar to ESP32 board_config.h pattern

### Phase 2: Receiver Dongle Implementation
1. **BLE Central Mode**: Scan for and connect to "AceRK" devices
2. **USB HID Output**: Forward reports to host computer via TinyUSB
3. **Connection Management**: Handle pairing and reconnection

## Required Libraries

### Core Libraries
- **Arduino BLE Library**: For Bluetooth LE functionality
- **TinyUSB**: For USB HID keyboard/mouse (built into Pico core)
- **LittleFS**: For file system storage
- **Arduino Core for RP2040**: Base platform support

### Custom Implementation Needed
- **BLE HID Service**: May need custom implementation for full compatibility
- **HID Report Descriptors**: Adapt existing descriptors for Pico W
- **Device Management**: Port existing device pairing logic

## Compatibility Assessment

### ‚úÖ Should Work

3. **Testing Requirements**: Need to verify compatibility with all existing platforms

## Recommendation

**Proceed with Pico W implementation** with the following approach:

1. **Start Small**: Begin with basic BLE HID transmitter
2. **Leverage Existing Code**: Reuse as much as possible from ESP32/nRF52840 implementations
3. **Test Early**: Verify BLE compatibility with existing receivers early in development
4. **Document Thoroughly**: Create comprehensive documentation for the new platform
5. **Community Feedback**: Engage with Pico W community for BLE implementation guidance

The Pico W represents an excellent opportunity to expand RelayKeys platform support while maintaining the project's commitment to accessibility and open-source hardware options.
