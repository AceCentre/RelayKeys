## AT Command Examples

### Send text "Hello"
```
AT+BLEKEYBOARDCODE=00-00-0B-08-0F-0F-12-00
```

### Move mouse right 10px, down 5px
```
AT+BLEHIDMOUSEMOVE=10,5,0,0
```

### Left mouse click
```
AT+BLEHIDMOUSEBUTTON=l,click
```

### List paired devices
```
AT+PRINTDEVLIST
```

## Development

### Code Structure
- `common/relaykeys_common.h` - Shared definitions and constants
- Platform-specific `.ino` files implement the AT command handlers
- Each platform uses its native BLE and storage libraries

### Adding New Platforms
1. Create new directory under `arduino/`
2. Include `../common/relaykeys_common.h`
3. Implement all functions declared in the common header
4. Follow the existing AT command structure

### Debugging
Uncomment `#define DEBUG` in the firmware to enable serial debug output.

## Receiver Dongle vs Transmitter

### Transmitters
- Act as BLE Peripheral devices
- Accept AT commands via serial or BLE UART
- Send HID reports to connected devices
- Support multiple device pairing and switching

### Receiver Dongles
- Act as BLE Central devices
- Automatically scan for and connect to "AceRK" transmitters
- Forward received HID reports via USB to host computer
- Useful for connecting RelayKeys to devices that don't support BLE
- Enable use with older computers or systems requiring USB HID

## Compatibility

This firmware is designed to be compatible with:
- RelayKeys Python daemon
- RelayKeys CLI tools
- RelayKeys Qt desktop application
- Any software using the RelayKeys AT command protocol

### Receiver Dongle Compatibility
- Works with any RelayKeys transmitter (nRF52840 or ESP32)
- Compatible with any USB HID-capable host system
- Supports Windows, macOS, Linux, and embedded systems
