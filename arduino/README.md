# RelayKeys Arduino Firmware

This directory contains Arduino firmware implementations for RelayKeys compatible hardware platforms. The firmware provides BLE HID (Bluetooth Low Energy Human Interface Device) functionality, allowing devices to act as wireless keyboards and mice.

## Supported Platforms

### nRF52840 (arduino_nRF52840_v2/)
- **Boards**: Adafruit nRF52840 Express, ItsyBitsy nRF52840, Raytac MDBT50Q-RX
- **Features**: Full RelayKeys compatibility, multiple device pairing, file system storage
- **Status**: âœ… Complete implementation

### ESP32 (arduino_ESP32/)
- **Boards**: ESP32-WROOM, ESP32-S3, and other ESP32 variants
- **Features**: RelayKeys AT command compatibility, BLE HID, NVRAM storage
- **Status**: âœ… Complete implementation

### Legacy nRF52840 (arduino_nRF52840/)
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ Original implementation (maintained for compatibility)

## Common Features

All implementations support the same AT command protocol:

### Keyboard Commands
- `AT+BLEKEYBOARDCODE=XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX` - Send keyboard HID report
- Special keys: Volume up/down, mute

### Mouse Commands
- `AT+BLEHIDMOUSEMOVE=X,Y,WY,WX` - Mouse movement and scrolling
- `AT+BLEHIDMOUSEBUTTON=Button[,Action]` - Mouse button actions
  - Buttons: `l` (left), `r` (right), `m` (middle), `b` (back), `f` (forward)
  - Actions: `click`, `doubleclick`, or press/release toggle

### Device Management
- `AT+BLEADDNEWDEVICE` - Add new device to pairing list
- `AT+BLEREMOVEDEVICE="DeviceName"` - Remove device from list
- `AT+SWITCHCONN[="DeviceName"]` - Switch between connected devices
- `AT+PRINTDEVLIST` - List paired devices
- `AT+BLECURRENTDEVICENAME` - Get current connected device name
- `AT+RESETDEVLIST` - Clear all paired devices

### System Commands
- `AT+SWITCHMODE` - Toggle between serial/BLE modes
- `AT+GETMODE` - Get current mode
- `AT+BLEMAXDEVLISTSIZE=N` - Set maximum device list size

## Hardware Requirements

### nRF52840 Boards
- **Adafruit nRF52840 Express**: Built-in NeoPixel, user button on pin 7
- **Adafruit ItsyBitsy nRF52840**: DotStar LED, user button on pin 4
- **Raytac MDBT50Q-RX**: Blue LED, user button on PIN_BUTTON1

### ESP32 Boards
- **ESP32-WROOM**: Built-in LED on pin 2, boot button on pin 0
- **ESP32-S3**: Varies by board manufacturer
- **Other ESP32 variants**: Adjust pin definitions in code

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. **Arduino IDE** with appropriate board support packages
2. **nRF52840**: Adafruit nRF52 board package
3. **ESP32**: Espressif ESP32 board package

### nRF52840 Setup
1. Install [Adafruit nRF52 Arduino Core](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/arduino-bsp-setup)
2. Select your board in Arduino IDE
3. Upload `arduino_nRF52840_v2.ino`

### ESP32 Setup
1. Install [ESP32 Arduino Core](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html)
2. Select your ESP32 board in Arduino IDE
3. Upload `arduino_ESP32.ino`

## Usage

### Initial Setup
1. Upload firmware to your board
2. Power on the device
3. The device will start in serial mode (green/solid LED)

### Pairing Devices
1. Single-click the user button to enter pairing mode (yellow/fast blink LED)
2. Connect your target device (phone, tablet, computer) via Bluetooth
3. Look for device named "AceRK"
4. Device will be added to the pairing list automatically

### Mode Switching
- **Double-click** user button to switch between serial and BLE modes
- **Serial mode**: Commands via USB serial connection
- **BLE mode**: Commands via BLE UART service (blue/slow blink LED)

### LED Status Indicators

| LED Color/Pattern | Status |
|-------------------|--------|
| Green/Solid | Serial mode, ready |
| Blue/Slow blink | BLE mode, ready |
| Yellow/Fast blink | Pairing mode |

## AT Command Examples

### Send text "Hello"
```
AT+BLEKEYBOARDCODE=00-00-0B-08-0F-0F-12-00
```

### Move mouse right 10px, down 5px
```
AT+BLEHIDMOUSEMOVE=10,5,0,0
```

### Left mouse click
```
AT+BLEHIDMOUSEBUTTON=l,click
```

### List paired devices
```
AT+PRINTDEVLIST
```

## Development

### Code Structure
- `common/relaykeys_common.h` - Shared definitions and constants
- Platform-specific `.ino` files implement the AT command handlers
- Each platform uses its native BLE and storage libraries

### Adding New Platforms
1. Create new directory under `arduino/`
2. Include `../common/relaykeys_common.h`
3. Implement all functions declared in the common header
4. Follow the existing AT command structure

### Debugging
Uncomment `#define DEBUG` in the firmware to enable serial debug output.

## Compatibility

This firmware is designed to be compatible with:
- RelayKeys Python daemon
- RelayKeys CLI tools
- RelayKeys Qt desktop application
- Any software using the RelayKeys AT command protocol
