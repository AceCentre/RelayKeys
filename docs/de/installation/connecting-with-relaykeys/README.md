# Connecting with RelayKeys

There are 3 broad configurations for RelayKeys

* Wired Mode. This is where one Bluetooth dongle is in the Sending device&#x20;
* Wireless Mode. This is where a Bluetooth dongle plugged into a power outlet or a battery sits away from the Sending device. This might be useful for devices where you cannot plug anything into the sending device
* Wired + Receiving Dongle. A receiving dongle sits in the receiving device. This is useful where "pairing" is unreliable on the recieving device or there is no Bluetooth stack on the receiving computer.&#x20;

You need to decide what is best for you.&#x20;
