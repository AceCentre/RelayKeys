# Checking it works

1. Open up something on the second computer that you can enter text into. E.g. Notes on the iPad, Notepad on Windows or Notes on a mac
2. On your server computer (the one with RelayKeys attached) run "RelayKeys" (search for it in your Windows search bar). Alternatively find it in `C:\Program Files(x86)\Ace Centre\RelayKeys\relaykeys-qt.exe`
3. With the window having focus - type into it. You should see the keystrokes appear on the second computer

## Using it with your AAC software

You can get going by using one of these example files that work with your AAC Software:

* [The Grid 3](../using-relaykeys/guides/grid3.md)
* [MindExpress](../using-relaykeys/guides/mindexpress.md)
* [Tobii Communicator](../using-relaykeys/guides/communicator.md)
* [Tobii Dynavox Snap](../using-relaykeys/guides/snap-corefirst.md)

When you are ready, [have a read of how to integrate the features you need](../../guides/basic-principles.html).
