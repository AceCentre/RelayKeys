# Wired Mode

## Plug-in Your RelayKeys stick & pair with a computer (Wired mode)

1. Make sure the Micro-USB connector is attached to the stick and then attach the female end of the USB lead into your computer
2. You should see your stick light a solid blue ("Paired") or flashing blue ("Un-paired")

If "Flashing". This means you have yet to pair the RelayKeys device with another computer.
