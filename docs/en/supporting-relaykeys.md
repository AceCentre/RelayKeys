# ❤️ Supporting RelayKeys

> It takes significant resources to maintain and advance RelayKeys. If you'd like to help keep RelayKeys active and open-source please consider supporting it through one of the methods below.

## Financial Support

Our development and research all cost money.  If you can spare the cash, we have a few ways to help us keep the lights on.

### Memberships

We accept memberships through our Patreon account. These monthly donations are the ideal financial contribution since  they're a bit more dependable and we can roughly predict the monthly amount. (**not yet released**)

### One-Time Donations

Please donate to us via [JustGiving](https://www.justgiving.com/onecheckout/donation/direct/charity/139889). Small or large donations welcome! 


### Pull Requests

Whether squashing [bugs](https://github.com/AceCentre/RelayKeys/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug), [optimizing](https://github.com/AceCentre/RelayKeys/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aoptimization) the codebase, increasing test coverage, or adding [new features](https://github.com/AceCentre/RelayKeys/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement), submitting pull-requests through GitHub is extremely valuable.

### Docs

No technical skills? Not enough time for a pull-request? No problem! We have plenty of [user guides and documentation](https://docs.RelayKeys.io/) that could use some extra attention. Fix spelling, add code examples, help organize, write new articles, or just check for [broken links](#)... it all helps.

### Translations

RelayKeys is a worldwide project. Our team and users are spread out across the globe and often speak different languages. If you do too, we'd love to get RelayKeys [translated into your native tongue](https://github.com/RelayKeys/RelayKeys/issues/1203). It's easy, and each new translation opens the door to a huge number of new users.

### Bug Reporting

This one is surprisingly underutilized. If you encounter a bug within RelayKeys, no matter how small, we would _love_ to hear about it. With such a small team, it's difficult for us to test every commit. Sometimes after we update a small snippet of code, a totally different piece of code breaks elsewhere. More people using and testing the software is always good, but if no one reports the issues they come across then it may not get fixed!


## Social Posts

Have a few followers on Twitter? A quick post mentioning our [@AceCentre](https://twitter.com/acecentre) account goes a long way. We've even been known to re-tweet some of our favorite shout-outs. And be sure to follow us to get the most up-to-date info on new features, releases, and sneak-peeks.

### Testimonials

One sentence. Even that was a sentence and it was only two words! If you're a fan of RelayKeys, we'd love to hear why with a short endorsement. Shoot us an email, Tweet, or [Slack](https://slack.RelayKeys.io) message. And if you'd like to have your testimonial [on our website](https://RelayKeys.io/#testimonials) be sure to include your name, title, company, and picture.
