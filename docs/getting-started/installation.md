# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

> The easiest way to get up-and-running is with the [Directus Suite](https://github.com/directus/directus), which includes the [Directus API](https://github.com/directus/api), the [Directus App](https://github.com/directus/app), and all dependencies.

## Requirements

Directus is developed and tested on the LAMP stack, and therefore this is the only officially supported environment. Alternate stacks (NGINX, Caddy, MariaDB, Percona, etc) may also work but you should proceed at your own risk. Please ensure your server meets the following requirements:

* **Apache**
* **MySQL 5.2+**
    * A Database (empty or existing)
    * A Database User (with access to database)
* **PHP 7.1+**
    * Extensions:  `pdo`, `mysql`, `curl`, `gd`, `fileinfo`, and `mbstring`

::: tip Detailed Requirements
View our [detailed requirements page](/advanced/requirements.md) to learn more about these requirements, neccesary permissions, and other server-specific prerequisites.
:::

## Setup

Running the following `git` command from your server's command line is the preferred method of installing the codebase.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/directus/directus.git
```

::: tip Other Install Methods
Alternatively, you can choose from one of these other installation methods.
* [Docker](/advanced/other-install-methods.md#docker)
* [Zip, Tar, or FTP](/advanced/other-install-methods.md#manual)
* [Standalone](/advanced/other-install-methods.md#standalone)
* [Source](/advanced/other-install-methods.md#source)
:::

::: tip
If you are using Apache, make sure `mod_rewrite` and `AllowOverride` are enabled. [Read more](../advanced/server-setup.md#apache)
:::

::: tip
If after installation you are experiencing missing functions or packages errors, [follow these steps](https://github.com/directus/api/issues/620#issuecomment-449905619) to recreate `composer.json` and update the composer autoloader. If there's already a `composer.json`, either run [`composer dump-autoload`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#dump-autoload-dumpautoload-).

## Configure

1. Set your document root to the `/public` directory
2. Navigate your browser to the App at `/admin`
3. Follow the prompts to complete configuration (see below)
