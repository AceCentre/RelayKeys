# Jabbla MindExpress

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you think about using RelayKeys for MindExpress have you tried using [MacroSever](https://www.jabblasoft.com/files/helpfiles/mindexpress5\_en\_webhelp/ta\_macro\_server\_installeren.html)? Its built into MindExpress. It works well - but does rely on a network/TCP connection to the secondary devices - which also need to run the software.&#x20;
