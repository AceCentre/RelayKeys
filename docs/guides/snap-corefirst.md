# Tobii Dynavox - Snap + CoreFirst

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you look at using RelayKeys with Snap have you considered [AccessIT 3](https://www.tobiidynavox.com/products/accessit-3)? Its available for TD software and is good! There are some snags - its not multi device compatible and does require the dongle being plugged in.&#x20;
