# Wired + Recieving Dongle

Plug in your receiving dongle to a device. Your device will see this as a keyboard attached. \
\
If you are asked to press some keys for the device to understand it, just close this window for now.&#x20;

On the sending side, it will pair by default with the receiver. You don't need to do a thing. \
\
However, if you have gone and paired with any other devices, you may find this not work. You will need to remove any paired devices and try again.&#x20;
