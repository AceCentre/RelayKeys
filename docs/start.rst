Getting Started with RelayKeys
===========================

RelayKeys is a software and hardware solution to send keystrokes, text and mouse commands 
from one computer to another. It makes use of lowcost electronics and open source software to do this
Some common reasons for doing this are:

* For people with disabilities to send text to a secondary computer - for example to demonstrate their writing ability
* For people who use a assistive technology device on one system to control another; for example eyegaze users have to use Windows devices right now
  RelayKeys enables them to use this access method to then control a different device; an iPad, a Work computer, a Apple Mac
* To control a second device from the command line - or from a on-screen app; whether thats to type emails on a phone or control a machine remotely

RelayKeys is an open solution for Assitive Technology organisations to use within their own code - we hope to provide examples. We have provided a Windows solution - an installer and a series of documentation to get commercial AAC software to work  with RelayKeys. In the long-term it is suggested that AAC software talks natively to the RelayKeys daemon.
