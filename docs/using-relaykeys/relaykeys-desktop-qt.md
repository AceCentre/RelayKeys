# RelayKeys Desktop (QT)

If you don't want to use any specific AAC software, you can get going with our demonstration software "RelayKeys-QT" (aka RelayKeys or RelayKeys Desktop). You will find this on your desktop as well as your start programmes if you have installed our software. It has 4 main buttons on the left:

### Capture

This screen enables you to capture the keystrokes and mouse movements and any captured input gets sent directly to the currently connected device. To connect a device - see "Devices" screen.

### Macro

This screen enables you to create a macro file. This records your mouse or keystrokes and enables you to play it back. This is useful for creating long sequences of commands or say for writing a common piece of text such as a signature. You can play it back in this software or use the macro with the [CLI](relaykeys-cli.md#command-f-file.txt-macro) tool.

### Connection

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-07-26 at 20.08.16.png>)

This screen enables you to switch between paired devices and change the current mode. This means the RelayKeys hardware can run either as a wired dongle or a wireless device. Use the switch mode to change these modes.

### Devices

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-07-26 at 20.08.26.png>)

This screen enables you to add and remove paired devices - as well as removing all devices from the relaykeys hardware.
